# tutorials_trajOptim_MPC
A simple and light-weight tutorial of trajectory optimization (TO) and model predictive control (MPC).

Different from the reinforcement learning (RL), TO and MPC are general model-based control methods, especially for legged robots and manipulators. 

This repository provides a simple and light-weight tutorial for TO and MPC. It is based on the TO software _trajOptim_ developed by M. Kelly, who currently works for Atlas in Boston Dynamics.
