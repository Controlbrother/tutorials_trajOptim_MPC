*** The scripts in this library is extracted from the Kelly's trajectory optimization (TO) software 'OptimTraj'.

*** If you want to learn the algorithm about TO deeply, I recommend you to read his tutorials about TO introduction. It is a very good introductory learning material.

*** Additionally, it is worthy reading the book named Practical Methods for Optimal Control and Estimation Using Nonlinear Programming written by John Betts.
